# Sparkmania Arcade ðŸŽ®

[Check out the project here](https://editor.p5js.org/jenna5376/full/e1CxxFbvU)

Sparkmania Arcade is an online arcade with three mini-games: wack-a-mole, bread shooter, and dance party. You can select one of six characters to play as, and you will get a total score based on your performance each round.

All assets were created in Procreate and the game was developed using p5.js (JavaScript library). Our team consisted of two game designers/developers.
