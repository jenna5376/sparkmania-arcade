# Sparkmania Arcade ðŸŽ®

[Try out the game here](https://editor.p5js.org/jenna5376/full/e1CxxFbvU)

Sparkmania Arcade is an online arcade with three mini-games: whac-a-mole, bread shooter, and dance party. You can select one of six characters to play as, and you will get a total score based on your performance each round. As my teammate (Tatiana Jimanez) and I were both fans of Nintendo games as kids, we wanted our game to bring back a sense of nostalgia and excitement!

All assets were created in Procreate and the game was developed using p5.js (JavaScript library).
